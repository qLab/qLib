"""A procedural digital asset library for Houdini. Copyright (c) 2008-2025, qLab"""

qLib is a procedural digital asset library for SideFX's Houdini.
It is a collection of tools designed to work in accordance with Houdini's native toolset.
It improves the production process by allowing you to spend more time on what you want to achieve
instead of how to achieve it.

qLib is open source software licensed under the New BSD license.
It's developed by VFX professionals from several studios, working on feature films,
game cinematics and commercials.
