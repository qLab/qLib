Jump to Path on Clipboard:
    After copying a path (absolute or relative) from a `ch()`-expression of a parameter,
    this function can be used to jump to the node pointed to the copied path.

    This will only work if the jump is done from the same context where the path from
    the expression was copied from.

Select:
    Select nodes based on their various states or properties.

Select with Parms:
    Select nodes with parameters matching various criteria.

    Animated (Keyframed):
        Select nodes that has parameters that have at least two keyframes.
        This will not select nodes with one keyframes or expressions.

    With Time-Dependent Parms:
        Select nodes that have parameters that change over time.

    With Expressions/Variables:
        Select nodes with parameters that have expressions or variables.

    With @-Variable(s):
        Select nodes that have parameters using any @-variables (see below).

        TIP:
            This can be very handy to find nodes in a network that are driven by
            LOPs context options, or PDG/TOPs.

    With C@ (Context Options):
        Select nodes that have parameters that use C@-prefixed variables
        (LOPs context options).

    With G@ (Geometry):
        Select nodes that have parameters that use G@-prefixed variables (geometry).

    With P@ (PDG/TOPs):
        Select noes that have parameters that use P@-prefixed variables (PDG/TOPs).
