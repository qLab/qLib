### About

qLib is a digital asset library for SideFX's Houdini.
It is a collection of tools designed to work flawlessly with each other
and Houdini's native toolset.
It is driven by (and used in) *real production environments*,
but at the same time it fully respects and conforms to all the important
Houdini concepts.

Strong emphasis on the following things:
- **Backwards-compatibility**: old scenes will _not_ break over time
- **Performance**: we press for VEX/multithreading as much as possible
- **Usability**: our tools try to avoid the "in-house" look-and-feel

qLib is **open source software** licensed under the [New BSD
license](https://github.com/qLab/qLib/blob/master/LICENSE). It's developed by
VFX professionals from several studios working on feature films, game
cinematics and commercials.

### Quick Installation

- Download the latest version (see link above)
- Extract and move it into the Houdini preferences folder in your home folder
- Append provided houdini.env example file contents to your own houdini.env
  - Alternatively, use a package json file (see below)


### Installation

#### 1. Getting qLib

You can either grab a compressed archive file (as mentioned above), or
you can clone the official repository with **git**.
(The archive way is the easiest, but with git you can update faster,
revert to previous versions quick, etc.)


#### 2. Adding it to the Houdini environment

##### Houdini 17.5 or higher ("plugin" method)

- Create a folder called **packages** in your Houdini preferences folder (in your home dir)
- Copy the **qLib_linux.json** (or **qLib_windows.json**) file into the **packages** folder
- Edit the json file to point to the extracted qLib folder (edit the path in the "QLIB" line)

[To read more on configuration, see the documentation on Packages](https://www.sidefx.com/docs/houdini/ref/plugins.html)

(Please note that qLib requires 17.5.321 or higher for its package to work.)

##### Older Houdini versions

We provide example *houdini.env* files (windows and linux) which can be
*appended to your houdini.env file in your Houdini preferences folder*
(the HoudiniXX.X/ folder in your home directory).

[To read more on configuration, see the documentation on houdini.env](http://www.sidefx.com/docs/houdini/basics/config_env)


#### 2a. Important note for facilities

If you're installing at a large facility with a package management system,
*do not rely on houdini.env files* --
use your package manager to set up environment variables.
